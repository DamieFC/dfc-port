# dfc-port
Idea for hardware port that can transfer storage, charge stuff, use for I/O devices, play records*, and broadcast radio*.
## Idea
```
---------------
| ||| + - ||| |
|  -       -  |
| ==- A A -== |
|  _       _  |
| ||| D D ||| |
---------------
```
### Key:
* + = 3v
* - = gnd
* A = analog
* D = digital

Heck, it'll maybe help my coding stuff.
